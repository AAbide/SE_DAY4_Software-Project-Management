2. Highly adaptable to change	
3. Continuous cycles (sprints)	
4. Involvement	High, with frequent feedback	
5. Ongoing throughout the project	
6. Functional increments delivered frequently	
7. Evolving projects with changing requirements	
**Waterfall Methodology**
1. Linear & sequential
2. Fixed, changes are difficult to implement
3. Defined, one-time phases (requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing ‚Üí deployment)
4. Minimal, primarily at the beginning & end
5. Happens after development is complete
6. Full product delivered at the end
7. Well-defined projects with fixed requirements

**Advantages & Disadvantages of Each Methodology**
**Advantages of Agile Methodology**
1. More flexible & adaptable ‚Äì Easily accommodates changing requirements.
2. Early & continuous delivery ‚Äì Provides working software in small increments.
3. Better client collaboration ‚Äì Frequent feedback ensures the final product meets expectations.
4. Faster detection of issues ‚Äì Continuous testing & iteration help identify and fix problems early.
**Disadvantages:**

2. Requires active client involvement ‚Äì This can be time-consuming for stakeholders.
3. Not ideal for strict compliance projects ‚Äì Regulated industries requiring complete documentation may struggle with Agile‚Äôs flexibility.

**Waterfall Methodology**
**Advantages:**
1. Clear structure & documentation ‚Äì Each phase is well-defined, making it easier to track progress.
2. Easier to manage timelines & budgets ‚Äì Since all requirements are gathered upfront, cost & time estimates are more predictable.
3. Better for large, well-defined projects ‚Äì Ideal for industries with strict compliance & regulatory needs (e.g., healthcare, finance).
**Disadvantages:**
1. Not adaptable to change ‚Äì Any modification requires restarting earlier phases, increasing costs & delays.
2. Late testing phase ‚Äì Bugs are often discovered too late in the process, making fixes expensive.
3. Risk of client dissatisfaction ‚Äì Since feedback is minimal until the project is complete, the final product may not meet expectations.

**What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?**
**Identifying Core Issues Addressed by Your Software**
Your software likely aims to solve one or more of the following problems:
1. Inefficiency ‚Äì Automating repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort.
2. Scalability ‚Äì Enabling businesses to grow without operational bottlenecks.
3. Lack of Accessibility ‚Äì Making services or tools available to a wider audience.
4. Security Risks ‚Äì Providing safer financial transactions, data protection, or compliance.
5. Customer Experience ‚Äì Enhancing engagement, user satisfaction, and seamless interactions.
**Why These Problems Are Significant to Your Target Audience**
Your audience needs practical solutions that:
‚úÖ Save Time ‚Äì Automating processes reduces workload and increases productivity.
‚úÖ Improve Accuracy ‚Äì Minimizes human errors in operations.
‚úÖ Enhance Convenience ‚Äì Provides seamless access to services or tools.
‚úÖ Ensure Security ‚Äì Builds trust in financial or business transactions.
‚úÖ Drive Revenue Growth ‚Äì Helps businesses scale and expand.

**How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?**
How Clearly Defining the Problem Leads to More Effective Software Solutions
Clearly defining the problem is the foundation of successful software development. It ensures that the solution is relevant, efficient, and meets user needs without unnecessary complexity or wasted resources.

1. Ensures a Targeted Solution
‚úÖ Why it Matters:
Helps developers focus on solving the real pain points rather than creating features that don‚Äôt add value.
Prevents scope creep by keeping the project aligned with specific goals.
üìå Example:
Vague Problem Statement: "Customers are unhappy with our booking system."
Clear Problem Statement: "Customers experience frequent booking errors due to poor UI design and slow processing times."
Impact: The development team now knows to focus on UI improvements and performance optimization instead of unnecessary changes.
2. Improves Requirement Gathering & Development Efficiency
‚úÖ Why it Matters:
Allows for precise feature planning, reducing the risk of costly modifications later.
Ensures teams build only what‚Äôs necessary instead of wasting time on irrelevant features.
üìå Example:
If the problem is high cart abandonment rates, defining it clearly helps identify the cause (slow checkout process, payment failures, or poor UX) and address it efficiently.
3. Enhances User Experience (UX) & Adoption
‚úÖ Why it Matters:
A well-defined problem leads to solutions that directly improve usability and customer satisfaction.
Increases software adoption by ensuring it meets real user needs.
üìå Example:
If an education platform struggles with student engagement, defining the issue (e.g., lack of interactive content, poor mobile optimization) helps create targeted solutions like gamification or mobile-friendly design.
4. Simplifies Testing & Quality Assurance
‚úÖ Why it Matters:
Allows for structured testing since the success criteria are well-defined.
Developers and QA teams can measure whether the solution effectively resolves the identified problem.
üìå Example:
If the problem is frequent system crashes, defining it clearly (e.g., occurs under high user load) enables precise testing under stress conditions.
5. Optimizes Resource Allocation & Budgeting
‚úÖ Why it Matters:
Developers, designers, and testers spend time efficiently on solving the right problem.
Prevents overspending on unnecessary features or scope creep.
üìå Example:
Instead of redesigning an entire app, a clearly defined problem (e.g., "Checkout page takes over 5 seconds to load") might show that a database query optimization is the only fix needed.
